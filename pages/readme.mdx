## Part 1

- This part is based on the usage of the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) user interface.
- The content is focused on common tasks an entry-level user could complete.
- The menu structure presents the more common tasks such as **Getting started**; publishing, editing, deleting, and managing posts; account management, and advanced configurations. It is organized following an incremental order, starting in the easier or initial tasks and going to more advanced content.
- As required, the project include a few guides with content. These guides are marked with the **memo emoji** (üìù). The rest of the files are empty and were created just to get a better presentation.

## Part 2

- This part is based on the REST services provided in [this page](https://dummy.restapiexample.com/).
- The section includes a [general reference](https://tech-writer-test.netlify.app/api-documentation/api-reference) presenting the API and explainning the available endpoints: retrieve data, create a new record, update a record, and delete a record.
- Besides the documentation in this project, the endpoints are documented in [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/36433185/2sA3XV8zGt).
- Before documenting the endpoints, they were also tested via Postman. In this matter, the **Update a Record** endpoint returned _Error 404_ in diferent moments.
