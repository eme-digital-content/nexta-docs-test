# Technical Writer Skills - Using Nextra

This project showcases technical writing skills through the development of documentation using the Nextra framework. The documentation is structured into two main parts, explained below.

It was developed using the [nextra-docs-template](https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template).

## Part 1

![Part 1 - Publifast Documentation Left Menu Project](public\images\part-1-publifast.png)

- This part is based on the usage of the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) user interface.
- The content is focused on common tasks an entry-level user could complete.
- The menu structure presents the more common tasks such as **Getting started**; publishing, editing, deleting, and managing posts; account management, and advanced configurations. It is organized following an incremental order, starting in the easier or initial tasks and going to more advanced content.
- The project include a few guides with content. These guides are marked with the **memo emoji** (üìù). The rest of the files are empty and were created just to get a better presentation.

## Part 2

![Part 2 - My Staff API Left Menu Project](public\images\part-2-apis.png)

- This part is based on the REST services provided in [this page](https://dummy.restapiexample.com/).
- The section includes a [general reference](https://tech-writer-test.netlify.app/api-documentation/api-reference) presenting the API and explaining the available endpoints: retrieve data, create a new record, update a record, and delete a record.
- Besides the documentation in this project, the endpoints are documented in [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/36433185/2sA3XV8zGt).
- Before documenting the endpoints, they were also tested via Postman. In this matter, the **Update a Record** endpoint returned _Error 404_ in different moments.
