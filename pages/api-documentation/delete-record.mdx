## How to delete a record

**My Staff API** provides an endpoint to delete any record from your database.

To do so, follow the instructions below.

> ðŸš¨ Deleting a record is a permanent action and cannot be reversed.

---

1. Run this `GET` request to list all your registered employee data.

```bash
curl --location 'https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```bash
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "employee_name": "Tiger Nixon",
      "employee_salary": 320800,
      "employee_age": 61,
      "profile_image": ""
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "employee_name": "Garrett Winters",
      "employee_salary": 170750,
      "employee_age": 63,
      "profile_image": ""
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "employee_name": "Ashton Cox",
      "employee_salary": 86000,
      "employee_age": 66,
      "profile_image": ""
    }
  ],
  "message": "Successfully! All records have been fetched."
}
```

3. Copy the `id` for the record you want to delete.
4. Run this `Delete` request to eliminate an employee record from your database.

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/delete/<id>/'
```

> ðŸ’¡ Replace `<id>` for the ID of your employee in your database.

5. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```bash
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": "3",
    "message": "Successfully! Record has been deleted"
}
```

Done! Your record has been deleted.
