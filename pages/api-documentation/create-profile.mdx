## How to create a new record

You can create and add new records to your database via **My Staff API**. This guide includes the instructions to complete this task.

### Creating a new record

1. Run this `POST` request to create a new employee record, including **name**, **salary**, **age**, and **profile image**.

```bash
curl --location 'https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/create' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "employee_name": "Jhon Moore",
  "employee_salary": "345",
  "employee_age": "23",
  "profile_image": ""
}
'
```

Replace the values as explained in this table:

| Variable          | Data Type | Description                                         |
| :---------------- | :-------: | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `employee_name`   |  String   | The name and last name of your employee             |
| `employee_salary` |  String   | The salary for your employee                        |
| `employee_age`    |  String   | The age of your employee                            |
| `profile_image`   |  String   | The URL to fetch the profile image of your employee |

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```bash
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
      "employee_name": "Jhon Moore",
      "employee_salary": "345",
      "employee_age": "23",
      "profile_image": "",
      "id": 9139
    },
    "message": "Successfully! Record has been added."
}
```

Done! You new record has been created successfully.

### Customizing the variables

You can add as many variables as required in your request.

This example will include `Location` and the `Team`, besides the default variables. In this case, the request body will be as follows:

```bash
curl --location 'https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/create' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "employee_name": "Jhon Moore",
  "employee_salary": "345",
  "employee_age": "23",
  "profile_image": "",
  "location": "Boston",
  "team": "Marketing"
}
'
```
