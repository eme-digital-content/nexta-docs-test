## How to update a record

After you [create a record](/api-documentation/create-record.mdx), you can update the registered data through **My Staff API**. Follow the steps explained below.

---

1. Run this `GET` request to list all your registered employee data.

```bash
curl --location 'https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```bash
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "employee_name": "Tiger Nixon",
      "employee_salary": 320800,
      "employee_age": 61,
      "profile_image": ""
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "employee_name": "Garrett Winters",
      "employee_salary": 170750,
      "employee_age": 63,
      "profile_image": ""
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "employee_name": "Ashton Cox",
      "employee_salary": 86000,
      "employee_age": 66,
      "profile_image": ""
    }
  ],
  "message": "Successfully! All records has been fetched."
}
```

3. Copy the `id` for the record you want to update.
4. Run this `PUT` request to update a specific employee record.

```bash
curl --location --request PUT 'https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/update/<id>/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "employee_name": "Jhon Moore",
  "employee_salary": "345",
  "employee_age": "23",
  "profile_image": ""
}
'
```

> ðŸ’¡ Replace `<id>` for the ID of your employee in your database.

Update the values as explained in this table:

| Variable          | Data Type | Description                                         |
| :---------------- | :-------: | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `employee_name`   |  String   | The name and last name of your employee             |
| `employee_salary` |  String   | The salary for your employee                        |
| `employee_age`    |  String   | The age of your employee                            |
| `profile_image`   |  String   | The URL to fetch the profile image of your employee |

> ðŸ’¡ Add any other variable you created for your database.

5. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```bash
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
      "employee_name": "Jhon Moore",
      "employee_salary": "345",
      "employee_age": "23",
      "profile_image": "",
      "id": 9139
    },
    "message": "Successfully! Record has been updated."
}
```

Done. Your record has been updated with the new data.
