# Technical Writer Skills - Using Nextra

This project showcases technical writing skills by developing documentation using the Nextra framework. The documentation is structured into two main parts, explained below.

It was developed using the [nextra-docs-template](https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template).

## Part 1

![Part 1 - Publifast Documentation Left Menu Project](public/images/part-1-publifast.png)

- This part is based on the usage of the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) user interface.
- The content is focused on common tasks that an entry-level user could complete.
- The menu structure presents the more common tasks such as **Getting started**; publishing, editing, deleting, and managing posts; account management, and advanced configurations. It is organized following an incremental order, starting with the easier or initial tasks and going to more advanced content.
- The project includes a few guides with content. These guides are marked with the **memo emoji** (📝). The rest of the files are empty, being created to improve presentation.

## Part 2

![Part 2 - My Staff API Left Menu Project](public/images/part-2-apis.png)

- This part is based on the REST services provided in [this page](https://dummy.restapiexample.com/).
- The section includes a [general reference](https://tech-writer-test.netlify.app/api-documentation/api-reference) presenting the API and explaining the available endpoints: retrieve data, create a new record, update a record, and delete a record.
- Besides the documentation in this project, the endpoints are documented in [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/36433185/2sA3XV8zGt).
- Before documenting the endpoints, they were also tested via Postman. In this matter, the **Update a Record** endpoint returned _Error 404_ in different moments.
